# touchutil

Make an external **USB touchscreen** work naturally on macOS — tap, scroll, drag, and edge swipes.

## The problem this solves

I plugged a portable touchscreen monitor into my Mac and found that macOS
treats it like a plain mouse. On an extended desktop, tapping the touchscreen
doesn't click where you touch — it clicks wherever the system cursor already
happens to be, on whichever display. There's no native macOS setting to map an
external touchscreen's absolute touch input to its own display.

`touchutil` fixes this: it reads the touchscreen's absolute coordinates via
`IOHIDManager` and maps every gesture to the right display.

> **Tested locally** with a **Goojodoq portable touchscreen monitor**
> (SiS HID Touch Controller). Other HID digitizer touchscreens should work too,
> but that's the panel it's been verified on.

- ✅ Apple Silicon + Intel (universal binary)
- ✅ No kernel extension, no SIP changes, no paid developer account
- ✅ Tap, double-tap, scroll, drag, long-press, edge swipes

## Limitations

- **Single-finger only.** Multi-finger gestures (pinch, two-finger scroll, etc.)
  require a DriverKit HID driver, which needs a paid Apple Developer account to
  sign and notarize. This tool uses `IOHIDManager` — free and userspace — and
  single-finger is the trade-off.

## Requirements

- macOS 11 or later
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (recommended) — or Xcode Command Line Tools for manual install

## Install

### Option A — Homebrew (easiest, recommended)

```bash
brew install --cask keys2505/tap/touchutil
```

No Xcode, no manual steps. Homebrew installs the app, sets up the login agent,
and starts it automatically.

**After install — grant permissions (one-time only)**

macOS will block touchutil until you grant two permissions under
**System Settings → Privacy & Security**:

| Permission | Why it's needed |
| --- | --- |
| **Input Monitoring** | To read raw touch coordinates from the touchscreen |
| **Accessibility** | To move the cursor and synthesize click events |

1. Open System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Input Monitoring** → enable `touchutil`
2. Open System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Accessibility** → enable `touchutil`
3. The app retries automatically once permissions are granted — no need to relaunch.

> These permissions stay local on your Mac. touchutil reads touch input only to
> move your cursor — it sends nothing anywhere.

To uninstall:

```bash
brew uninstall --cask touchutil        # remove app + stop login agent
brew uninstall --cask --zap touchutil  # also delete saved config
```

### Option B — pre-built binary (no Xcode needed)

1. Download the latest `touchutil.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/keys2505/touchutil/releases/latest) page.
2. Unzip and run the installer:

```bash
unzip touchutil.zip
cd touchutil
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

To uninstall:

```bash
./scripts/uninstall.sh          # remove app, agent, CLI link, permissions
./scripts/uninstall.sh --purge  # also delete saved config
```

### Option C — build from source

Requires Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keys2505/touchutil.git
cd touchutil
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

The installer builds the app, copies it to `/Applications`, links the CLI to
`/usr/local/bin/touchutil`, and sets up a login agent so it starts
automatically. After install, grant the two permissions described above.

## Usage

```bash
touchutil           # auto-detects the touchscreen display
touchutil --setup   # pick the touchscreen display and remember it
touchutil --test    # open gesture-feedback window for testing
```

Touch the screen — the cursor follows your finger and responds to gestures.
Your `--setup` choice is saved to `~/.config/touchutil/config.json` and reused
on every run.

### Supported gestures

| Gesture | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Tap | Click |
| Double-tap | Double-click |
| Long-press (~0.5s) | Right-click |
| Vertical swipe | Scroll up / down |
| Hold 0.35s then drag horizontally | Select text / move windows |
| Edge swipe from any edge | Mission Control (show all windows) |

### Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--setup` | Pick & remember the touchscreen display |
| `--test` | Open a gesture-feedback window on the touchscreen |
| `--no-gestures` | Plain pointer only (no tap / long-press / scroll / edge-swipe) |
| `--list-displays` | List displays and detected touch devices |
| `--list-devices` | List all HID devices |
| `--inspect` | Dump a touchscreen's HID capabilities |
| `--display-index N` | Map touch to display index `N` (remembered) |
| `--vendor-id 0xVVVV` / `--product-id 0xPPPP` | Match a specific touch device |
| `--debug` | Log raw HID events to stderr |
| `--debug-log` | Log raw HID events to `/tmp/touchutil.debug.log` |
| `--version` | Print version and exit |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `IOHIDManagerOpen failed` | Grant **Input Monitoring**, then re-run |
| Cursor doesn't move | Grant **Accessibility**, then re-run |
| `--list-devices` shows nothing | Plug in the touchscreen's **USB data cable** (separate from video) |
| Touch lands on the wrong screen | Run `--setup`, or pass `--display-index` |
| Scroll feels like text selection | Swipe more vertically — horizontal swipes drag instead of scroll |
| Not sure what gesture was detected | Run `touchutil --test` to see real-time gesture feedback |

## How it works

`IOHIDManager` matches the touchscreen digitizer, reads absolute X/Y + tip
switch from each HID report, and maps the normalized coordinates onto the
chosen display. Gestures are recognised from movement direction and timing.
Click events are posted via `CGEvent` without manual click-count manipulation —
macOS counts consecutive taps naturally, exactly like a real mouse.
A display-reconfiguration callback refreshes the target when you rearrange or
hot-plug displays.

## Contributing

Bug reports are welcome — please open a GitHub issue and include:
- Your macOS version
- Your touchscreen model and the output of `touchutil --list-devices`
- What you expected vs. what happened

For code changes, open an issue first to discuss before sending a PR. This
project is intentionally minimal — patches that add complexity without a clear
use case are unlikely to be merged.
